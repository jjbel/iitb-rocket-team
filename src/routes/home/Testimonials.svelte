    " Working in the IITB Rocket Team has been a rewarding experience. As a
    Junior Design Engineer in my second year, I gained hands-on experience in
    developing rocket motor systems from scratch. My climax as Team Leader being
    responsible for the overall direction of the team and ensuring successful
    project execution was a dynamic journey filled with challenges and learning
    opportunities."

    "The collaboration, innovation, and dedication within our team have not only
    deepened my understanding of avionics but also fueled our collective
    success. I have learnt countless things ranging all the way from telemetry
    and communication to data processing and navigation and I am determined to
    continue pushing boundaries and introducing innovations in this exciting
    field."
